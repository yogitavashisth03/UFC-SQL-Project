# 🥊 SQL Project – UFC Fight Data Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project explores **UFC fight data** using SQL.  
It covers a variety of analytical queries such as fighter performance, win/loss records, striking accuracy, fight outcomes, and event statistics.  
The goal is to strengthen SQL skills by applying **aggregation, joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions** to real-world styled sports data.

## 🛠️ Skills & SQL Concepts Used
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `ROUND`)  
- Filtering (`WHERE`, `HAVING`)  
- Grouping (`GROUP BY`)  
- Subqueries & CTEs (`WITH` clause)  
- Window Functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)  
- Conditional Logic (`CASE WHEN`)  
- Joins (INNER, LEFT)  
- Ranking & Percentages

## 📊 Key Queries & Insights
Some example analyses included in the project:
- 🔹 **Title Fights** – List all title fights with winners and event locations.  
- 🔹 **Fighter Activity** – Find how many fights each fighter participated in.  
- 🔹 **Most Wins** – Identify fighters with the highest number of victories.  
- 🔹 **Fight Duration** – Calculate average fight duration per division.  
- 🔹 **Never Defeated** – List fighters who have never lost a fight.  
- 🔹 **Knockout Kings** – Top 5 fighters with the most KO/TKO wins.  
- 🔹 **Finish Rate** – Which division has the highest average finish rate.  
- 🔹 **Strike Accuracy** – Fighters ranked by average strike accuracy in wins.  
- 🔹 **Win Percentage** – Win ratio for fighters with at least 5 fights.  
- 🔹 **Rivalries** – Pairs of fighters who fought each other multiple times with win/loss breakdown.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ufc-sql-analysis.git
## ▶️ How to Run
2. Import the dataset into your SQL environment (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite).  
   *(Dataset is not included here. If you want to replicate, use a UFC fight dataset or create mock data.)*  

3. Run queries from `ufc_sql_project.sql`.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** for schema understanding  
- Create **Power BI / Tableau dashboard** for visualization  
- Automate query execution with **Python + SQL connection**
